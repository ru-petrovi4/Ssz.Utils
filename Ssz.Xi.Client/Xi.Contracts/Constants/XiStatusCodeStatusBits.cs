	/// <para>The Status Bits are the high-order 6 bits of the high-order byte (the StatusByte) of the XiStatus 
	/// code as defined in Xi.Contracts.Data.XiStatusCode.  The high-order two bits of the Status Bits are the 
	/// Status Group bits. They indicate whether a value is good, bad, or uncertain and when bad, whether or 
	/// not the bad status was assigned by the server. Server assigned bad status codes are typically assigned 
	/// when the server is unable to retrieve the value from the underlying system.</para>  
	/// <para>The four bits following the two Status Group bits indicate the reason associated with the Status 
	/// Group bits value.  The final two bits of the StatusByte are the limit bits. Their values are defined 
	/// in Xi.Contracts.Contstants.XiStatusCodeLimitBits.  This layout is summarized as follows.</para>

	/// <para>    RRRR   = Reason Bits </para>
	/// <para>    LL     = Limit Bits </para>
	/// <para>In the value definitions for the StatusBits, GG values are individually defined, but the 
	/// Reason Bit values are defined in combination with the Group Bits as GGRRRR. The Limit Bits are 
	/// separately defined in Xi.Contracts.Contstants.XiStatusCodeLimitBits.</para>
	/// <para>This class defines values for the 2-bit Status Group Bits, the 6-bit Status Bits, and 
	/// additional values for their manipulation, such as bit masks and shift values.</para>
	/// <para>In general there are two definitions for each 2-bit Status Group Bits value and each 6-bit 
	/// Status Bits value.  One value is the hex representation of the two-bit value or the six-bit value. 
	/// The other is the hex representation in the context of the full 32-bit Xi Status Code. For example,
	/// the GG bits for the Uncertain value are 01. Therefore, the two definitions for it are: </para>

	/// <para>The BadServerAccess values are used to indicate that the Xi server was unable to access 
	/// the data object value from the underlying OPC Classic server or from the underlying system.</para>
	/// <para>In general an HRESULT value of SUCCEEDED(hr) returned by the OPC Classic server indicates 
	/// successful access of the data object. In these cases, the Xi server would normally use the OPC 
	/// Quality returned with the data object value to construct the Xi Status Code.</para>
	/// <para>However, there can be HRESULT values that are SUCCEEDED(hr), but that indicates that the OPC 
	/// Classic server was unable to access the data object, and where the OPC Quality returned is not useful. 
	/// In these cases, the Xi server can construct an Xi Status Code that indicates BAD SERVER ACCESS. 
	/// BAD SERVER ACCESS can also be constructed by the Xi Server when the returned HRESULT indicates
